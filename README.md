# Classification - CelebA

## Towards a Comparative Study of Machine Learning Models and Deep Learning Techniques for Multiclass Facial Recognition: Implementation and Analysis using Olivetti Faces and Celeb A Datasets 
Keywordsâ€” computer vision, machine learning, deep learning, neural network, multinomial logistic regression, support vector machines, multilayer perceptron


Implementation of 4 model types: Multinomial Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Multilayer Perceptron and Convolutional Neural Networks considering the task of classifying human faces

Some remarks:
- Two datasets were used: Fetch Olivetti Faces[1] and Celeb A[2]
- The Machine Learning models Multinomial Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines and Multilayer Perceptron were implemented from scratch using Pandas and Numpy
- The CNN models used were AlexNet and MobileNetv2.
