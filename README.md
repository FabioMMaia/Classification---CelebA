# Classification - CelebA

## Abstract— Practical and comparative study considering implementation and application of Classical Machine Learning Models along with Deep Learning techniques on a multiclass task of people recognition. 
Keywords— computer vision, machine learning, deep learning, neural network, multinomial logistic regression, support vector machines, multilayer perceptron


Implementation of 4 models types: Multinomial Logistic Regression, Suport Vector Machines, Multilayer Perceptron and Convolutional Neural Networks considering classification task of human faces

Some remarks:
- Two datasets were used considering the main goal: Fetch Olivetti Faces[1] and Celeb A[2]
- The Machine Learning models Multinomial Logistic Regression, Suport Vector Machines, Multilayer Perceptron were implemented from scracth using pandas and numpy
- The CNN models used were AlexNet and MobileNetv2.
